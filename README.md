# MobileApp
This is a simple mobile app for a fitness center where the users can make appointments through the application. The app is written with the Ionic framework. 

PS: node_modules folders were deleted before pushing to github to reduce folder sizes, hence the app cannot be directly run on your local machine. But you can inspect the code through Github.
